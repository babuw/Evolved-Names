# Evolved-Names

Java program that creates a predefined string by guessing random characters following Wagner-Fischer algorithm
Imagine a virtual world in which all that exist are strings of characters from the following set
{ A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, _, -, ’ }
(The ‘_’ represents the space character.)
Strings in this world can reproduce new strings and die if they are not fit enough.
We will evolve strings in this world until they spell the desired name. To do this, 
we will create a Genome class, which will contain a list of characters from the above set 
representing a string in our world, and we will create a Population class which will contain 
a list of Genomes representing all the strings in our world.
